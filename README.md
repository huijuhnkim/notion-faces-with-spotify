## NFWS(NOT NSFW): Notion Faces With Spotify. 
Creates Notion Face, a custom profile image, based on your music taste on Spotify. 

## Next Steps
- [X] Fetch and display user's top artists/tracks
- [ ] Categorize facial elements in Notion Faces
- [ ] Convert endpoint data to personal musical taste
- [ ] Map facial elements with musical taste
- [ ] Display output
- [ ] Set up a demo account and activate on Spotify Web API
- [ ] Polish docs and readme

## Dev Notes
### Limitations to Spotify API Development Mode, and its workaround
Spotify API no longer provides detailed audio features to individuals.
Therefore, I would have to come up with a custom model for deriving musical taste based on limited data.
